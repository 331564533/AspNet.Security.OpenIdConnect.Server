==================================

**Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server** is an **OpenID Connect server middleware** that you can use in **any OWIN-powered application** and that works with the official **OpenID Connect client middleware** developed by Microsoft or with any **standards-compliant OAuth2/OpenID Connect client**.

## Get started

Based on **Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth**, **Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server** exposes similar primitives and can be directly registered in **Startup.cs** using the `UseOpenIdConnectServer` extension method:

    app.UseOpenIdConnectServer(options => {
        options.UseCertificate(certificate);
        options.Provider = new CustomAuthorizationProvider();
    });

See [https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server/tree/dev/samples/Mvc](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server/tree/dev/samples/Mvc) for a sample **using MVC 6 and showing how to configure a new OpenID Connect server using a custom `OpenIdConnectServerProvider` implementation to validate client applications**.
